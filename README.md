### Methodology
- The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to detect and handle outliers.
- The process includes calculating Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile),
- computing the IQR, and defining lower and upper bounds to identify outliers.

### Why IQR?
- IQR is a robust statistical method that is not affected by extreme values.
- It is especially useful when the data is not normally distributed and helps
- in improving model performance by removing noise.

### Impact of Outlier Removal
- After applying the IQR method, the dataset became more balanced.
- Removing extreme values helped in reducing skewness and improving
- the reliability of further analysis and machine learning models.

### Conclusion
The IQR technique proved to be an effective method for identifying and handling outliers. Proper outlier treatment improved data quality and created a strong foundation for accurate analysis and modeling.
